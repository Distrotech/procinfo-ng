Description: Displays system information from /proc
 Procinfo is a small program that gathers some system information from
 diverse files under /proc and prints it to the screen. It duplicates some of
 the functionality of free(1) and uptime(1). This also includes lsdev for
 displaying information about installed hardware and socklist for displaying
 a list of open sockets
 .
 Lsdev is a Perl script that attempts to tabulate DMA, IRQ and I/O port
 allocation per kernel driver.
 .
 Socklist is a Perl script that gives you a list of all open sockets,
 enumerating types, port, inode, uid, pid, fd and the program to which
 it belongs.
